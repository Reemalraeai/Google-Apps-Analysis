Data Source:

PORJECT PROCESS

Importing & Exploring:
-	Import suicide rates dataset
-	Explore the dataset
   o	see the first 5 rows (head())
   o	see the number of columns & rows (shape)
   o	see the statistical summary (describe())
   o	Check the missing values (info())
   o	create a boxplot & histogram to inspect the distribution of the data and inspect the outliers 
   
   ![Boxplot 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71211875/127317739-5845dd5a-4630-45b5-ad2c-dd1753ed993c.GIF)

As it is shown in the boxplot, there is an outlier value reflects a rating score approximately equals to 19, and this rating score is not true (Rating score in this case is from 0 to 5)


Data Cleaning 
1-	Inspecting Outliers 
Inspecting the outliers value by calling google_data[google_data.Rating > 5]  and droping the outliers

2-	Removing 90% Empty Rows  
Create a threshold to help in dropping 90% empty rows, and use the variable to drop the 90% empty rows 

'''threshold = len(google_data)*0.1 #10% of the rows (10840)'''


Data Imputation & Manipulation 

1-	Filling the Missing Values in Rating Column 

Define a function that will impute median for the missing values and then apply it to Rating column 

'''def impute_median(series):
    return series.fillna(series.median()) '''
    
2-	Filling the Missing Values of the Categorical Type Column

Fill the missing values in Type, Current Ver, Andorid Ver Columns (because they are categorical) with mode

3-	Converting Columns into Numerical Values

Convert Price, Reviews, and Installs columns into numerical values 
After finishing the imputation and manipulation, take a look at the dataset using head() & describe()


Data Visualization 

The point is to visualize & analyze rating, price, reviews, and installs against their respective categories. To do so, we need to group by category and aggregate the values by mean for Rating, Reviews, & Installs and by sum for Price.


'''grp = google_data.groupby('Category')
Rating = grp['Rating'].agg(np.mean)
Price = grp['Price'].agg(np.sum)
Reviews = grp['Reviews'].agg(np.mean)
Installs = grp["Installs"].agg(np.mean)'''

After grouping, each variable was plotted against the respective category as it is shown below

RESULTS
According to the analysis: 
Education & Event categories have the highest rating and Dating category has the lowest rating.
Finance, Family, Lifestyle, and Medical Categories score the highest in terms of price respectively.
Communication, Social & Game categories score the highest number of reviews.
Communication category has the highest number of installs.
